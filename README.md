## python-challenge
This assignment was in two parts. 
### Pybank
We had to analyse the financial records of a company using the 'Budget data' given to us.
I added up the total number of months and calculated the net total of the companies profit or loss as well as calculated the average change over the 86 months from above. Next part was to find the month of the greatest increase and greatest decrease and the amounts.

### Pypoll
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
On the second part of this assingment an 'election data' dataset was provided.The total number of votes was first calcalated using the count function. Then I had to loop through the rows, get the candidate names and count each of their total votes then workout their respective percentage votes. Finally I used the greater than function to extract the winner.
 After all the calulations I then printed it to the terminal and a new analysis file using the print and with open function.
